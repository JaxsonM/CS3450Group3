| Benson | Project Manager |

We will all take turns being scrum master.

## Software Development Process
The development will be broken up into five phases.  Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile 
method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized. Then, using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address. The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current 
Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some 
risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, 
etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and 
analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a 
retrospective.

| Phase | Iteration |
| ----- | --------- |
| Phase 1 | Requirements Capture
| Phase 2 | Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design
| Phase 3 | Implementation, and Unit Testing
| Phase 4 | More Implementation and Testing 

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component 
interactions, and behaviors.

## Policies, Procedures, and Tools For Communication
We will be using discord for all text, voice, and video communication.

We will have a standup meeting every Monday and Wednesday at 6:00 PM. This will be done over a voice call. If we have any problems, Jaxson will organize another meeting.

## Configuration Management
