Plan Sprint 1 Dev: 

Beginning and end:
Ends: March 1
Hours: in meeting 3, out meeting 6 for 9*4 = 36 hours (assuming 3 meetings and 2 hr work between meetings)
We will all be available to work, will probably need to meet over discord due to meeting places and transportation.
Metric for retrospective: learning and work done? Idk

Benson is Scrum Master.
