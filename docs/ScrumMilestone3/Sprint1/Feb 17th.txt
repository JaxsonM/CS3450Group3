Work on car details page, will need api to finish. 
Learning sequelize.

Jaxson:
Some basic questions on login.

Notes:
Mentioned spring break.
Little change from last meeting do to short time between. 
Our sub ticket method of dividing tickets end up making the burn down awkward and only would adjust when large ticket groups were resolved.
